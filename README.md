# Pancake

A lightweight and extensible Entity-component system (ECS)-driven game engine written in Java.

## Committing and Publishing

By default, PRs and pushes to `master` will not publish new artifacts.  
Use the `MAJOR`, `MINOR`, or `PATCH` keywords in a commit message to publish new artifacts from the build of that commit.
